CS246 Demo Plan

For each test outlined below please use the executable ./hydra with -testing on the command line.

Test 1: If the card’s face value is strictly less than the value of the top card of any head (an ace is considered to have the value 1, and so has the lowest value), the card may be placed, face up, on that head.
Input: 
2
3
D
2
C
1

Test 2:  If the card’s face value is equal to the face value of the top card of any head, the card may be placed, face up, on that head, but this ends the player’s turn immediately, and they draw no further cards.
Input:

Test 3: If the top card of any head is an ace, and the played card is not, then it may be placed, face up, on that head.
Input:
2

D

Test 4: If the player has no reserve, and there is more than one head, they may place this card into reserve. To do so, the player simply places the card, face down, in front of them.
Input:

Please continue with this input for test 5 

Test 5: If the player has a reserve, then the player may swap the played card for the reserve card.
Input:
K 
H
0 (you will be asked to choose the card value again in testing mode but you will see the reserve pile is full after swap)

Test 6:  We can specify a joker's value and place it on a head according to the rules of the game as if it were the value we assigned it, and, the joker retains its announced value as long as it remains on top of the head it was placed on, so in our above example, the next player must treat the joker as an ace, 2, or 3 (whichever it was announced to be), not a joker.
Input:
